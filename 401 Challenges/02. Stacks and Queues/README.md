# Challenges for Stacks and Queues

## First
- implement basic functionality and tests

## Second 
Create a new class called pseudo queue.
- Do not use an existing Queue.
- Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
- Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
