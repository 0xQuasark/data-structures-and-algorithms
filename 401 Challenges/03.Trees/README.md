- [Whiteboard](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/miqIvWwab)
- ([Code](Trees.js))
- ([Tests](trees.test.js))


## Second Challenge
### Problem Domain
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

### Assignment
- I took the same function for the inOrder, but instead of adding the values to an array, I just got a temp max value variable and returned that.
- No whiteboard was done, as it was an iteration of a prior function


## First Challenge

  - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
