# Singly Linked Lists

Working with the Linked List data type

## Whiteboard Process
- in class with Jacob 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- I analyzed the code from Jacob, and then tackled the problems presented.
- Big O complexity:
  - insert()  o(n)


| Function | Big O (Complexity) | Space |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| insert() | O(n) | O(1) |
| includes() | O(n) | O(1) |
| toString() | O(n) | O(n) |

## Solution
- Code is to be found [here](linkedList.test.js)
